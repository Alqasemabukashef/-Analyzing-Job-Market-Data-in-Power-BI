# Analyzing Job Market Data in Power BI

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Power BI for analyzing job market trends, specifically in the data science industry. Using job posting data, this analysis uncovers patterns related to job titles, salary trends, applicant numbers, required skills, and industry demand.

## Purpose
The goal of this case study is to explore market trends for data science roles, helping recruiters and professionals better understand the dynamics of job postings, salary expectations, and required skills.

## Project Details
The data consists of job postings from 2017 to 2021, including key details like job title, company, industry, location, and salary range. Through Power BI, this data is visualized to provide insights into:
- The demand for various job positions (e.g., Data Engineer, Data Scientist).
- Trends in salary ranges and required years of experience.
- Key skills in demand within the job market.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Import**: Import the dataset containing job postings.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleanse the data using Power Query to remove inconsistencies and ensure accuracy.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform an initial analysis to understand trends in the data.
4. **Data Modeling**: Build relationships between data tables and create calculated fields using DAX.
5. **Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations to highlight key insights, such as:
   - Job title vs. salary
   - Job market demand over time
   - Skills vs. job titles
6. **Dashboard Design**: Create user-friendly dashboards to communicate findings effectively.
7. **Sharing**: Share the dashboard using Power BI Service for collaboration and feedback.

## Key Insights
- **Job Postings**: The number of job postings has been increasing steadily over the years.
- **In-demand Positions**: Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Analysts are seeing high demand.
- **Salary Trends**: Salaries in the data science field are trending upward.
- **Top Industries**: Tech industries are the primary drivers of job openings in data science.

## Final Deliverables
- Power BI report with multiple interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- Insights into trends and recommendations for DataSearch, a fictitious recruiting firm.

## How to Use
1. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop to view and interact with the dashboards.
2. Use Power BI Service to share and collaborate on the reports.
